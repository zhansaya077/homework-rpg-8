/**
 * Abstract base class for tower floors, using the Template Method pattern.
 *
 * The public explore() method defines the fixed skeleton for exploring a floor:
 *   1. announce()            — print floor introduction (can be overridden)
 *   2. setup(party)          — prepare the floor (abstract; subclass implements)
 *   3. resolveChallenge()    — conduct the floor's challenge (abstract; subclass implements)
 *   4. awardLoot()           — grant rewards if applicable (abstract; subclass implements)
 *   5. cleanup(party)        — clean up after the floor (optional hook; can be overridden)
 *
 * Subclasses must:
 * - Implement all abstract methods: getFloorName(), setup(), resolveChallenge(), awardLoot()
 * - NEVER override explore() — it is final
 * - Optionally override the hooks: announce(), shouldAwardLoot(), cleanup()
 *
 * This is the Template Method pattern in action: the algorithm skeleton is fixed in the
 * final method, and subclasses customize the details.
